  HOW IT WORKS: The Carousel Container (.carousel)
  - This is the visible 'window' or 'viewfinder' for your slides.
  - 'overflow: hidden;' is the MOST IMPORTANT property. It hides the parts of the 
    '.carousel-track' that are outside its boundaries, so you only see one slide at a time.
  - 'position: relative;' is useful if you ever want to add 'next'/'previous' buttons 
    and position them absolutely within this container.

/* 
  HOW IT WORKS: The Track (.carousel-track)
  - This element holds all your slides. We use 'display: flex' to arrange them in a single horizontal line.
  - The width is calculated as: (Number of Slides) * 100%. 
    You have 6 slides, so the total width is 600%. This makes the track six times wider than the '.carousel' window.
*/

  animation: slide 20s infinite; /* Applies the 30-second 'slide' animation on a loop. */
}

/* 
  HOW IT WORKS: The Slides (.slide)
  - Each slide needs to occupy its portion of the track.
  - Since the track is 600% wide and there are 6 slides, each slide takes up 1/6th of the track's width.
    (100% / 6 slides = 16.666%).

/* 
  HOW IT WORKS: The Animation (@keyframes)
  - This is where the movement happens. We are telling the '.carousel-track' how to move over time.
  - 'transform: translateX()' moves the element horizontally. We use negative values to move it to the left.
  - The track moves left in steps. Each step is the width of one slide (16.666%).
  - The keyframe percentages (0%, 15%, 16.6%, etc.) control the timing. We create a 'pause' on 
    each slide by setting the same 'transform' value for a start and end time.
